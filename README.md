# Description
This is a custom Kasumi Mai cursor I made for our the maifia leader. Hope you enjoy.

# Free to edit
Feel free to edit/modify the cursor and you can even make a pull request or report bugs.

# Install
For now the only operating sistem that the cursor supports is Windows (Also feel free to make versions for linux and macOS)

# Windows

**1-** First you have to unzip the `MAIFU CURSOR.zip` for this you can use [7 Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [WinRar](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) I recomend 7 Zip but both work. Place the unziped folder in a place you remember. (I recomend the documents folder).

**2-** Search up _Cursor_ in Windows start menu (bottom left) then click _change the mouse pointer display or speed_.

**3-** Click _Pointers_.

**4-** Select _cursor type_ and _browse_.

**5-** Go to the folder with all the mai cursors.

**6-** Select the cursor whith the same name as the cursor in the mouse properties `Ex: "base" in the settings and "mai_base_cursor.ani"`

**7-** Repeat and apply ! !

**8-** ENJOYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
